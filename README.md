Make an application which stores names and email addresses in a database (SQLite is fine). Make sure it:

Has welcome page in http://localhost/ 
Note: this page has links to list and create functions
Lists all stored names/email address in http://localhost/list
Adds a name/email address to the database in http://localhost/add 
Note: should validate input and show errors
